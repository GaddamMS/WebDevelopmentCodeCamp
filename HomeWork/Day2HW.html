        <h2>When She Gets Stuck To The Window Screen</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Does your cat manage to get stuck to the window screen every single day without fail?
            Even if you trim her claws frequently and make sure to keep them short?
            Have you ever come home from work to find your cat stuck?
            Who knows how long she's been sitting there.
            <b>Well, follow these simple instructions to free her!</b>
        </p>
        <h2>The Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask her: "Are You Stuck Again??"</li>
            <li>Make sure to give her a good scratch</li>
            <li>Gently lift up (&UpArrow;) her paw, while soothing her with your calming voice</li>
            <li>Give her some love (&hearts;)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your cat should now be free, and you can go back to playing the new <i><a href="https://animal-crossing.com/">Animal Crossing</a></i> or 
            watching <i>Love is Blind</i> on Netflix</p>

        <p>Look at how relaxed she is now:</p>
